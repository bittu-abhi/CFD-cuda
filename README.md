# CFD using CUDA
Cuda based CFD codes on different bodies. The goal is to learn parallel processing and computational fluid dynamics using GPU, Since GPU uses a massive parallel architecture. I have not completely optimised any code. 

Two folders - 1.AUSMPlus which again has two sub folder of two geometries - a back step and a cylinder
2.Lid Driven Cavity

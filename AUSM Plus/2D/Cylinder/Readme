Here, AUSM+ mehtod is applied to a 2D cylinder for the calcualtion of convective fluxes. Parallelisation is done using CUDA.
I tried to solve the flow at inlet condition of 10 m/s sec, but since this is a compressible solver, i get a "NAN" error. However,
at speeds greater than 50m/s, the solver is stable. This is only till the high subsonic range. In supersonic range, the solver,
blows up due to not up to the mark implementation of boundary conditions. Initial conditions can be changes in the file starter.cu

If possible, improving the mesh would help. The current mesh is just a test mesh to test the solver. Hence, with the current mesh, one
might even obtain a back flow infront of the cylinder region. The mesh files are divied as follows:
Nodes - gives the (X,Y,Z) location of each of the 4 nodes of the elements
Element - gives the node number of the correspoinding node (i.e. what number to use to find its co-ordinate in the Nodes.txt)
boundary - gives the node number which are part of the boudary. Helpful to identify the boundary

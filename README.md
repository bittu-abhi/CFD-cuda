# CFD using CUDA
Cuda based CFD codes on different bodies. The goal is to learn parallel processing and computational fluid dynamics using GPU, Since GPU uses a massive parallel architecture. I have not completely optimised any code. 

There are two geometries present. The first one is a relative simple back step geometry. The second one is a cylinder

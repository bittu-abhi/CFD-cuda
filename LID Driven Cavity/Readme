This a LID driven cavity code. There are two formulations present(both use the vorticity stream function equations).
The flow is considered as incompressible one. The number of points can be changed. (at the time of uploading ts 500).
The following are the two formulation/discretisation :-

1. Forward in time and central in space.(FTCS)
2. Forward in time and 6th order compact for space ( both first and second derivative).

The code has been parallelised using NVIDIA-CUDA. Both the formuations can be used either independently or together.
The FTCS is present in the file secondW.cu . Just use the function secondW with the  required parameters

NOTE: Due to error in my part, the X acts as Y and vice versa. So while visualisation this has to kept in mind.
